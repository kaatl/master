@AlexanderOsdal @LarsCBlast @carlarne1 @kkullebo No, I do not mean that. I just mean that the relationship does not exist. One can be successful with and without many local players

@AlexanderOsdal @viks1981 @carlarne1 @kkullebo LAN does not develop the base of talents. I have said that he will not be responsible. But LAN got rid of Knudsen, Huse, Larsen, Hansson and more. LAN did not get Zachen, Glesnes et al. There are objective facts. He is responsible for that.
@spenteigen @JuneLarsson @Rolf_k_y @frp_no @SVparti @Stortinget Then I misunderstood, and then my above tweet also looks very wrong.
@coys05091882 @OnkelErvin @GSkinnes @SV_Karin That's why the left-hand side is left-hand side: They have never cared so much about the facts. Coming from there, so I know. When you begin to ask critical questions about your own political perceptions, you get to the right.
Here I find myself a little "in the middle of the tree". I can not say I totally agree with everything Jan Schjetne criticizes here, ...
@Integrated If you do not see that there is a moral index finger that blames her, I'm very surprised.
@Pamerotti @LarsCBlast @carlarne1 @kkullebo Yes. I see that the teams with a lot of "local playtime" do not fight at the top. That could not be a goal!
@ellefsens @kjetilhoho @KJulLarsen Otherwise, it is usually the one that comes with characteristics and prosecutions that have the burden of proof. Not least, it applies to a field where cultural life, despite record allocations, has so much hate against the minister, and many claim that the Right will put down all cultural policies.
@AlexanderOsdal @Pamerotti @carlarne1 @kkullebo It is not necessarily "local" that is the keyword. Must it be quite obvious that over time it will be an advantage if you can establish among the better development arenas for both local and other talents? Something, among other things, the God and S08 have been proficient.
@Landsbroderen I could say just the same, but never mind anyway. I see a person who is easily informed that people never learn, I'll give you. I am, however, myself.

@ellefsens @kjetilhoho @KJulLarsen That sister is not her word. This was a discussion with @kjetilhoho. The first point is: The Minister of Culture's statements here are sketches for an analysis of changes in culture and its expressions, and with questions about implications for politics.

@GudimStrom @JuneLarsson @Rolf_k_y @frp_no @SVparti @Stortinget Nothing wrong with it whatsoever. I had only appreciated if they were a bit honest than they like to make it. There's nothing wrong to be for everyone to get lost. That is at least honest.
Remember when I was little and a guy told his friend "see her alien hands" on a handball voice. 10 years afterwards, he tried to find me at a place and I just "like alien hands now suddenly" and went.

@Skotkjerra @MBegnum What I like best with the checklist is the points are so short and concrete, and yet understandable. I look at it as a booklet for what you can & amp; should handle themselves before user testing and the like. Maybe the breakdown of technical / design / content is enough.
@kjetilnfjell But there is no moralization, whatsoever. It is 100% pragmatic risk assessment. But people who like such behavior will push me into the moral box because they do not want to take into account the risk.
Today, King Winter has laid his silent white robe over the fall. And even though I do not like him anything special, he brings a strange calm with him when he lets snowflakes fall towards the ground .. Something's over. Something new has started its journey. Another winter is waiting.

@CilieBedsvaag Not true? The staff at the law office are not in doubt. From the attorney's assistant:

Seems it is strange that Mowgli in the jungle book soapass works well cognitively in view of its growth. Seems almost too good to be true. Ps: Alf Tande P has written the youth book: The league of leaning hearts.
@OdaRygh @elvelol This is awesome written and very true! I am very familiar with it, especially since I have a professional letter as a child and youth worker, and that was what was going to wreak me out psychologically, I never believed in VGs.
You're kidding now, right? Had either sponsored a contradiction to @NaturogUngdom to prevent economic growth and stability for future generations!
@KennethKHaug @IncUbusHgrAn True, a little hard word choice to say that Italy is failing in total.

@Intended to steal naked images. Yes, you can ALWAYS have higher security around their things. That does not mean that the main reason for the images being leaked is that NOW STATED THEM. Someone with such a moral compass does not realize that the pictures are private and not for anyone other than the owner.

"Dramatic time on the bomb market"
1/2 sigh. Now, the FrP reiterates that many asylum seekers came to Norway in 2015 because Ap invited them here. The first time they said it, everyone saw that it was an absurd assertion. But it is repeated and repeated. The truth is that many people came to Europe in 2015.
@Revetal @KurtSteinar @anitadutch @BjrnOveStrand @MarianneM10 @oleroll @Betho1311 @ringtila King winter came here too
The record for Frp is the jam a deep hack in. Why do they still drive and invite Afghans to come here and what are they constantly scared of? #Stortinget
Deja vu! The land on Gardermoen and we had to walk down the stairs, it was snowing. It took me back to the day we landed at Fornebu, once more than 37 years ago. When Norway welcomed us with open arms. Imagine if anyone who came here was received in the same way. After all, it was good! (I think)

@MortChr @thorbjarnebore Has not asked for a ban of frp I. I thought they had a certain intellectual capacity of Christianity. This is a bit like this level now. do you want children to get food? like and share. yes, of course.
@TV2NorgeFantasy @Petter_Myhre A swap and nothing in the bank
Breakfast has nothing in bed to do!
@coys05091882 @GSkinnes @Oddingen @SV_Karin Expenses with immigration have nothing to do with what we have discussed. You mix the cards and track off. Q. in the cases that were published. Here is whether Norway is following its international obligations. We do not discuss immigration as such. See ya!
@martineaurdal @Arbeiderpartiet @jonasgahrstore What does the workforce actually mean about the intrusion prophylaxis? I do not understand what the party or @jonasgahrstore mean or does.
Government Attorney: Climate Affairs has nothing in court to do -
There's nothing wrong with sending nude pictures, what's wrong is spreading them on. @GeorgeGooding
Government Attorney: Climate Affairs has nothing in court to do
@katjanouch It's like nothing!
The whole dps hour is about my ocd and I concluded that it's not soooooo big problem. Also learned that I only have treatment until Christmas so I do not understand
@OnkelErvin @Genkinnes @Oddingen @SV_Karin For example, there is nothing about how many asylum seekers in each country.
Nothing is decided in the match for the champions in Drammen when three race days are left:
The proposal to ban the serious part of the labor industry in the construction industry has nothing to build a serious work life to do!
@Grest_ @KitanoX42 @Marie_H_ @annjorn @SimenSund Has nothing to do with my skull, but some are more in love with anecdotes and approximations than empirical data.
Now Greenpeace leader in Norway, Truls Gulowsen in the witness box. He talks that environmental concerns are still overrun by short-term economic interests. # Climate action
The big gap that Roberts talks about has obviously arisen because the elite no longer cares about ordinary people's problems, nor lets take them seriously. Holst and Roberts function is to make explanations that suit the elite.
Do you ever cross your ankles in the dentist? Why in the world you do, you can read about the BUTTONS, ...

@v36ar @KSteigen @Tarequn Good possible Harstad is an element, but not the whole reason. Talking from 19 years of experience growing up there. ;)
@spenteigen @JuneLarsson @frp_no @SVparti @Stortinget So that means that @SV_Karin does not speak true when she says they will be for controlled immigration / reception of refugees? Now you try on spin, Espen.
@johanlund Milinkovic-Savic, we speak beautiful football player. Few missing and just getting better and better.
@KJulLarsen @ellefsens She is not talking exclusively about TV? She exemplifies how cultural expressions change because they media in new ways.
"- If you can listen twice as much as you speak ..."
#AP digs its own grave deeper. Good for then will be d long until they come to power again: D
It's nice how the FRP can be overtaken in its own very important case and will be sitting in government. Works best about scaring people in the election campaign.
@Arbeiderparty's strategy succeeded. Proud Member Now. Those who have signed out - in fairness frustration - sign in again. Today. @SnorWik
@Pamerotti @viks1981 @carlarne1 @kkullebo "Of course, it's not a LAN's fault" and "Of course, he has a lot of responsibility". Javisstnei ...
@MathiassenJan @sandoy_sand @GeorgeGooding Absolutely, the point is that many trust their own IT skills. Most people say they should not have to think about it, it's the hacker's fault, great. Do you lock the door to prevent burglary?
@KriseKarro @edelmariehurra @femaleviking Can take daddy (dry white freaks): Do you know why standing sexual intercourse is forbidden in the reclamation? Because it can lead to dance.
Today it's 110 years since Astrid Lindgren was born! So many childhood children she brushed up with her writing and imagination. Also mine. ☄ May the words live forever.
@Ivarserdeg @Landsbroderen Is a difference to being supportive instead of yelling and getting Abraham to sacrifice his own son to God, thus.
@chicarianne @Mare_Argent @Landsbroderen You can do exactly what you want, so you'll see if I could answer just the same questions that Dæven Døtte has suggested.
Just check out spam and do not understand why I'm single.
@andhalse Just like everyone who sat in the transportation committee before you. Eye-opener!
Joakim Kjørsvik's Fabulous Collection With Stories People I Remember have just come to the world. Hurray!
It's nice little that reminds me more than just this today.
@Landsbroderen I could say just the same, but never mind anyway. I see a person who is easily informed that people never learn, I'll give you. I am, however, myself.
@VGSvea @arilasos Good changes in my opinion. Just read this matter
Here I had just got back the old nissedesignet på mjukkartongane, and so do they make a new one ?!
@twentyonesivan thanks! is alone in the gym right now btw
And just as I started to indulge the brotherly people this:
@raptoren Thanks :) It went Ok, just have to start with new epilepsy medications
He later went far to ask Listhaug to finish the job. Such a wish from Giske has even less power than when the finance minister says she does not trust the SSB director.
@coys05091882 @GSkinnes @Oddingen @SV_Karin There you went to the trap, I see. Enters the feel, left and right sides. Having a proper assessment of this type of affair is not a political point of view. See here if you want to know more about the statistics:
Remember when I was little and a guy told his friend "see her alien hands" on a handball voice. 10 years afterwards, he tried to find me at a place and I just "like alien hands now suddenly" and went.

@spidergawd_band missed shirt purchases when playing on the cave, is it possible to send one, buy online electricity?
@Stortinget You push the expenses on their work people.? Is it working politics. The AP lost, because the people went to elections on the basis of asylum policy.
It went as I said, now the climate scientists read that humanity dies out to stop Co2. -I told you so ....
"From 2011 to 2015, the proportion of poor in Norway increased from 7.7 per cent to 9.3 per cent of the population."! "Full 17.5 ...
Feir the protection of 10 unique forests with Hans-Petter #Jacobsen in NRK p1 +! Did you miss it? @VidarHelgesen
@ThomasBreivik72 @bareenmann @mvbcdo At the same time, I think most people had reacted if children were dressed like nuns:
@ThomasBreivik72 @bareenmann @mvbcdo Well. Do not think most people had rave on the eyebrows of children who went with a necklace with crescent + star, given.
... and there it went from 1,620 to 1,850.
Will there be two wonderful people on tonight, which I KNOW can help with this, thankfully !!

The routine rides this evening are canceled due to the lack of horses.
@nikkischei Ahhhhh A little early .... Should change to winter tires tonight ...
Nice with Sweden! Tonight Denmark can follow! Both countries are used to having fun at the expense of Italy and dancing to their frustration!
Rune Jarstein plays his international match No. 50 tonight! Slovakia - Norway at 18.00 on MAX!
Proper bread. Bake Off? No, please
Many thanks for the talk and lecture, @kirstenmarie where you make us laugh in Danish and Norwegian * Is maybe good point in the aforementioned NO WHAT FANDEN
@TheDamnVol Or spelling / grammar
@AngryByDefault NO! Faen, you have to fill up the fridge with beer. Sattan
@cekicozlem no, Horsens library arranges a bus to #bogforum every year, but I did the most for you
Oh yes no: Irish profiles are getting ready for Hareide's troops

From the hall: - Birgit, yes or no, are you satisfied with what we get for the money in the municipality. #frhpol
@AsbjoernC @NielsKristensen @Kristianthdahl No, there is not a Låsby Rønne
@Maggu8 Yes, if one were relevant among the national teams, it would have been a little funeral, but no ..
@roarmoen @ArveSystad @GeorgeGooding ID theft: about 5% of the population over a year's time. Same in most "rich" countries.
@t0mmy_sf Aaah! Had enough to do the same myself I did not get tired of it
@geirilja1 @bareenmann So. WE KNOW that girls are exposed to threats, violence and exclusion to using hijab. Do you really mean that there is a problem in * near * of the same order of magnitude that someone then feels "discomfort" by going with the hijab volunteer? Then you have no sense of propositions.
Not least this constellation of the Christian Wallum Red Ensemble from the same year.
@KitanoX42 @Grest_ @Marie_H_ @annjorn @SimenSund There is a news case about this and I advise people on how to avoid harboring the same trap. It's not a personal touch.
@KristianJahr @eivstra Same as here.
@Rune_1975 @sandoy_sand @GeorgeGooding However, it's significantly less likely than someone to steal your phone / hacker facebook etc / bruteforcer your password or get your password from another site they hacked as you've used (ie you're more vulnerable if you use same username / password on multiple sites).
Will not be more interested in sending you the same mail three times ...
@fredriksolvang @estigarild @Siv_Jensen_FrP @mariannemar We are playing "bullshit bingo" and "reboot" where we give politicians points for "focus", "pressure", "long term" and different ruling techniques. I think "bla-bla-bla" is just another way to say the same. xD
@Marie_H_ @KitanoX42 @Grest_ @annjorn @SimenSund In the same way as society "avoids responsibility" for homes by expecting people to lock their door. That's not really because it's not about eliminating any responsibility for criminal acts, but that people do factual risk assessments and shield themselves from unwanted behavior.
@Inserdeerdeg Someone is not to trust the same what you do. But if you do not hold people accountable for their bad moral choices and foolish behavior, at least you can not do anything about it. Why are you so blame for those who steal the pictures?
@GeorgeGooding @Marie_H_ @KitanoX42 @Grest_ @annjorn @SimenSund Just as you wish you can stand in the cold naked without dying of it, you may want no one to steal your car. In both cases, it is not your responsibility to decide whether or not it will happen.
@spenteigen Now that's happening first, we will of course criticize listhaug. Lord AP has no credibility anymore.
Known tactics: First, come up with a completely hopeless proposal. Then come up with a slightly smaller (but still) hopeless proposal that gives the impression of having been adapting the opposition, but still reaching the original goal. Say that "Now we must agree ?!" Clout. #ikstart
@Pamerotti @LarsCBlast @carlarne1 @kkullebo The mountain public is impatient. When it starts to boil on key people, the end will be close to them ... So, of course, they will not be cheated.
@Pamerotti @LarsCBlast @carlarne1 @kkullebo "What so"? Do you think you should have a lot of playing time for local, just to have a lot of time for local? People want results first and foremost. And those with a lot of playtime for local, have not achieved Burn's results. Keep in mind that only RBK has taken more points than Brann in total in 2016 and 2017.
@Pamerotti @carlarne1 @kkullebo Nja. It was not primarily the young people who failed sporting. But when the situation became really precarious at the end, I do not think there was any benefit to having many young and inexperienced on the team.
First of all, how much they share with Mew, especially on the Iselilja album.
At least nobody should blame @sthobro for not boasting when she first eats healthy.
The 2004 Indie must have been working with terrible force on this boy. only realized now (new single on the radio) that the killers are a big tulle band.
@fredriksolvang @olstad40 @opposition Perhaps you may agree that Jensen escaped the Solvang I personally like best, like: "First, you can start answering my question" and the grilling of other politicians rightfully. Especially because Jensen is so rhetorically good.
@JohnniGade no going back once you've tried it on PC;)
Ok then, if it's going to be winter it's nice with snow.
See and hear the Spanish version of the TV series! (For BT subscribers)

RV17 - debate Djursland: Can you hear some regional council candidates? About. 800,000 Danes have hearing problems, and approx. 300,000 have hearing aids. Listen ...
On the first Friday, Janove will release the single "Weapons" where Ane Brun is with as a duet partner. Listen to the taste bite here.
New from GLR Nuortamielli kindergarten very critical to the municipality's accounting skills: Will the kindergarten accept the kindergarten supplement they have received? Håkon Hansen does not believe in the figures anymore.

Anyone who knows about #CommunitiesThatCare is used in Norway? @NAPHA_nytt
@tommynius @Thomanasty Neither chess, skiing, handball is worth it. Guarantees more watching football and Eurovision than the other three. And those who know me know I do not recognize handball, chess or skiing.
Today's most important contribution? @researchers know where the shoe pushes in recruitment settings # forskpol17
Do you know someone who has reacted?
@KriseKarro @GladWold @femaleviking @edelmariehurra But in the picture it is not said that Christians experience more mockery, but that it is more accepted to mock them. I know that again.
The feeling that the teacher knows the child should all parents bring after the parental conversation. But to get as much time as 30 minutes, unfortunately, not everyone knows.
@eivindtraedal Do not really mean this, but be home in the districts and find out that everyone I know is climate neglected and thought it could be a raw personality trait for me too
Incomprehensible, unnecessary and untenable. "(..) but so is the system once again."
@Adriansen A little more empathy in the monitor thanks. You do not know her, details of what she has been through or why she really stands out. I think and hope it can help others who experience the same.
