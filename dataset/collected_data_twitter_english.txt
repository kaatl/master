@AlexanderOsdal @LarsCBlast @ carlarne1 @kkullebo No, I do not mean that. I just mean that the relationship does not exist. One can be successful with and without many local players

@AlexanderOsdal @ viks1981 @ carlarne1 @kkullebo LAN does not develop the base of talents. I have said that he will not be responsible. But LAN got rid of Knudsen, Huse, Larsen, Hansson and more. LAN did not get Zachen, Glesnes et al. There are objective facts. He is responsible for that.
@spenteigen @JuneLarsson @Rolf_k_y @frp_no @SVparti @Stortinget Then I misunderstood, and then my above tweet also looks very wrong.
@ coys05091882 @OnkelErvin @GSkinnes @SV_Karin That's why the left-hand side is left-hand side: They have never cared so much about the facts. Coming from there, so I know. When you begin to ask critical questions about your own political perceptions, you get to the right.
Here I find myself a little "in the middle of the tree". I can not say I totally agree with everything Jan Schjetne criticizes here, ...
@Integrated If you do not see that there is a moral index finger that blames her, I'm very surprised.
@Pamerotti @LarsCBlast @ carlarne1 @kkullebo Yes. I see that the teams with a lot of "local playtime" do not fight at the top. That could not be a goal!
@ellefsens @kjetilhoho @KJulLarsen Otherwise, it is usually the one that comes with characteristics and prosecutions that have the burden of proof. Not least, it applies to a field where cultural life, despite record allocations, has so much hate against the minister, and many claim that the Right will put down all cultural policies.
@AlexanderOsdal @Pamerotti @ carlarne1 @kkullebo It is not necessarily "local" that is the keyword. Must it be quite obvious that over time it will be an advantage if you can establish among the better development arenas for both local and other talents? Something, among other things, the God and S08 have been proficient.
@Landsbroderen I could say just the same, but never mind anyway. I see a person who is easily informed that people never learn, I'll give you. I am, however, myself.

@ellefsens @kjetilhoho @KJulLarsen That sister is not her word. This was a discussion with @kjetilhoho. The first point is: The Minister of Culture's statements here are sketches for an analysis of changes in culture and its expressions, and with questions about implications for politics.

@Natteramnoslo @Regjeringen It must be concluded that @frp_no defines Norwegian immigration policy. And those who support the sitting government should be careful about talking about detail management.
@KriseKarro @GladWold @femaleviking @edelmariehurra But in the picture it is not said that Christians experience more mockery, but that it is more accepted to mock them. I know that again.
@vgnett It is not talked about what can probably be the demise of humanity and animals, like nuclear power when one of them is hit by a natural disaster, as in Japan still destroying the world's food fat with radioactive emissions without the power station still?
Thank you for an interesting day at # agendanordnorge2017. The working life of the future offers more challenges, but at the same time many opportunities. @NHOkristin and I discussed some of them today.
@Edwini do not think either Brecel or Trump will be WM they are too outrageous and there will be many parties for them
@Integrated So. To encourage children to take care of themselves and to think about security in meeting with the Internet and technology: Great. To blame them when someone steals their pictures and spreads on the web: Terrible bad way for a parent to act. I can not see how this is to

If I had been a cool journalist, I would like to see how WikiLeaks' reputation among Norwegians has had a bit of a journey. A story about double standards and hypocrisy.
@shift @Skotkjerra If the list covers everything you need to keep in mind for inclusive web design solutions, I miss a lot, especially on process and UX design, and also a little bit of expert testing. But should it only support best practice in work, it looks good!
@matiashs If you absolutely should be so literal, here's another example: It's a green man, a car comes in full swing against the walkway, without any signs of stopping. Do not cross the gangway then just because "it's a green man and it's illegal to drive down people, so I'm going over the principle"
Norway has increasing inequality and poverty, especially among immigrants. Imagine if we had an integration minister in Norway, I think that would help significantly.
@vbsaga bullshit. In the series "obvious and intentional consequences of decision", one must have realized that the percentage of temporary stays would increase. Vingling and "how to polish a turd" is what this is called.
@kjetilhoho @KJulLarsen @ellefsens - & gt; It could be hindered or delayed by charging books, subsidizing theater, or by regulations / prohibition. But such a policy would in itself be a change of culture and principles. Thinking about what it would mean that the novel became more important is not market coverage.
The question is as ethical complex as "what would you do in 1940 if a Jewish family with fake papers had been on the stairs and asked for help?".

@Inswererdeg I would NEVER look at my broken daughter and told her, "This had never happened if you just had to take those pictures." That's NOT what a supportive parent would do.
@fredriksolvang Of course, the director of dairy products says it's healthy. The NRA would also refer to "research" around the weapon not killing. lol The best thing about this debate was your own closing case. : P
To make sure that the naked images are out of the question: do not steal them.
Scary to think that Norway is now going to collapse as a society, since Ap adopted an extremely elaborate proposal to take more attention to children on leave.
Today, it's a bit better to be Norwegian. I'm hoping that one day I'm going to be proud of this nation, #Oktoberbarna
@ KitanoX42 @Grest_ @Marie_H_ @annjorn @SimenSund There is a news case about this and I advise people on how to avoid harboring the same trap. It's not a personal touch.

@edelmariehurra @GladWold @femaleviking I'm trying to get on a Christian witness ... Can not I believe.
@GladWold @femaleviking @edelmariehurra Clear. A lot of Islam satire in Norway as well. Robert Stoltenberg's Imam sketch is legendary. But I think the principle that Christians become hot "more" than other religions is a bomb.
@Spotify think it's fun to shuffle all the damn summer songs in the world while waiting for the bus in a snowstorm. Bang out of order.
@Pamerotti @ carlarne1 @kkullebo Nja. It was not primarily the young people who failed sporting. But when the situation became really precarious at the end, I do not think there was any benefit to having many young and inexperienced on the team.

@Integrated "victims" anyone. Being supportive to their children when they go through a highly devastating and traumatic experience is of course. To see her in the eyes and to blame her is completely ill.

Card usage increased 3.8 percent compared to October 2016. Almost 60 percent of all purchases were less than 200 kroner. Suitable for contactless cards. And all indications that Christmas is trading this year too :)
@Volldal @Snorkfroken @VingaGjerstad To sneak on others is bad morale. The feminists lie on the couch and support themselves without bothering to lift a finger for their own entertainment. Everything is to be paid by others. Grauthuene supports child welfare and everything that is public because they are so sadly dependent on themselves. Feminism = brain death

@GeorgeGooding @Marie_H_ @ KitanoX42 @Grest_ @annjorn @SimenSund So just own the necessity then ... Do not have mobile, tv, nice clothes, good food, holiday trips, etc. etc, they can be stealing / going wrong and we are not vital things
Should disclose the solution of not losing anything in a discussion, not a tile, nada, nevah. Do not go into discussion.
@GeorgeGooding @Marie_H_ @ KitanoX42 @Grest_ @annjorn @SimenSund So what can be stolen should we not own and anything that can go wrong should we not do? It will be pretty safe ...

Today, Norway's first climate case began. Who is in charge of nature? What happens to the policy when the globe becomes a client in court? A new issue of "New Norwegian Journal" writes Jørn Øyrehagen Sunde on "Climate Change and Democracy":
Who chooses gender-based education?
The question may be, whoever earns to make this case so damned complex and complicated. (Hint: Frp.)
Who chooses gender-based education?
@roarmoen @sjefersuper @GeorgeGooding Call your bank and make arrangements, call your family and tell that you are dead, talk to whom you are talking and potentially kissed relationships, spread untrue rumors about people (ergo make life sick for others without knowing it yet ...) ... List is long. Data security must be taken seriously.
